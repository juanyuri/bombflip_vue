Hello everyone!
My name is Yuri and I'm a Computer Scientist in Galicia, northwest of Spain.

## The Game
The main objective of Bomb Flip is to flip cards without uncovering a Bomb. The cards contain numbers from 1 to 3 or a Bomb. The player must use logic and deduction to identify which cards are safe to flip based on numeric clues provided by rows and columns.
